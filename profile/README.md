I’m Jozz. I created this organization for all my packages with one clear goal:  

At the core of my philosophy is an uncompromising focus on four things: developer experience, performance, reliability, and clarity.
Every package is built to feel intuitive and effortless from the first line of code — no boilerplate, no surprises.
Under the hood, each tool is engineered for speed and minimal overhead, optimized down to the byte.
It’s not enough to just work — it must work flawlessly under real-world pressure, which is why everything is battle-tested and production-grade.
And finally, every concept is backed by simple, honest documentation that makes understanding and using the tools as straightforward as possible.

1. Zero Friction - No setup files. No repeated strings. No unnecessary classes. If it can be done in one line, it will be.
2. Clarity First - Every tool should feel like it's part of the language. No confusing APIs. No magic. Just clear, powerful functionality.
3. Tested Relentlessly - Every edge case matters. Every line is verified. When you ship with jozzdart, you can trust what’s under the hood.
4. Practical Utility - These tools are born from real apps — not toy problems. They exist because I needed them. You probably do too.
5. Built for Scale - From small side projects to enterprise-scale apps, everything here is designed to scale up with zero rewrites.
