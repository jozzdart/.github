I’m Jozz. My focus is simple: developer experience, performance, reliability, and clarity. Every package is easy to use from the first line, no boilerplate, no surprises. Under the hood, it’s fast and lightweight, built to handle real-world pressure. Everything is tested, production-ready, and backed by clear, honest docs.

### I value:

1. Zero Friction – No setup files, no repeated strings, no clutter — one-liners wherever possible.
2. Clarity First – Feels native, reads clean, no magic or confusing APIs.
3. Tested Relentlessly – Every edge case matters, every line verified — production-ready by default.
4. Practical Utility – Built from real-world needs, not toy problems — tools I needed, and you probably do too.
5. Built for Scale – From tiny projects to enterprise apps — designed to scale with zero rewrites.
